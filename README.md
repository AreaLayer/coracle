# What is this?

Coracle is a web client for the Nostr protocol. While Nostr is useful for many things, Coracle focuses on providing a high-quality user experience. Check it out at [coracle.social](https://coracle.social).

[Dufflepud](https://github.com/staab/dufflepud) is a companion server which you can self-host. It helps Coracle with things like link previews and image uploads.

Coracle is currently in _alpha_ - expect bugs, slow loading times, and rough edges.

# Bugs

  - [ ] User detail is not filtering by author
- [ ] Add alerts for replies to posts the user liked
- [ ] Support bech32 keys/add guide on how to convert
- [ ] With link/image previews, remove the url from the note body if it's on a separate last line
- [ ] Stack views so scroll position isn't lost on navigation
- [ ] We're sending client=astral tags, event id 125ff9dc495f65d302e8d95ea6f9385106cc31b81c80e8c582b44be92fa50c44
